# Simulation project

# Overview

The code in this repository is used in Freya Thomas' PhD Thesis Chapter Four: a field ecologist's adventures in the virtual world: using simulations to design data collection for complex analysis. This is also a paper in preparation: Thomas, Vesk & Hauser (in prep) A field ecologist's adventures in the virtual world: using simulations to design data collection for complex analysis.

The purpose of this code is to create a fieldwork simulation based around collecting multiple plant species heights at different time-since-fire sites in the Victorian Mallee. 
Each R script contains the same code, but with different deterministic and stochastic inputs relating to different 'Constraint Scenarios'. This code produces multiple datasets for each constraint scenario.
